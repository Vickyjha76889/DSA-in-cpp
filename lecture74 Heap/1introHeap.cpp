Got it 👍 Let’s go step by step and keep it in **DSA perspective** for C++.

## 🔹 What is a Heap?

* A **Heap** is a special type of **Binary Tree** (more specifically a **Complete Binary Tree**) used to efficiently implement **Priority Queues**.
* It is not a data structure built into C++ directly, but it can be implemented using arrays or used through STL (`priority_queue`).

---

## 🔹 Properties of a Heap

1. **Complete Binary Tree**

   * Every level of the tree is completely filled except possibly the last level, which is filled from **left to right**.

2. **Heap Order Property**
   Two types:

   * **Max-Heap**: Parent node ≥ child nodes. (root is the maximum element)
   * **Min-Heap**: Parent node ≤ child nodes. (root is the minimum element)

---

## 🔹 Example

### Max-Heap

```
        50
       /  \
     30    40
    / \   /
  10  20 35
```

Here, each parent is **greater than or equal** to its children.

### Min-Heap

```
        10
       /  \
     20    15
    / \   /
  30  40 50
```

Here, each parent is **smaller than or equal** to its children.

---

## 🔹 Heap Representation in C++

* Heaps are usually stored in **arrays** (not linked nodes).
* For a node at index `i` (0-based indexing):

  * **Left child** → `2*i + 1`
  * **Right child** → `2*i + 2`
  * **Parent** → `(i - 1)/2`

Example (Max Heap as array):
`[50, 30, 40, 10, 20, 35]`

---

## 🔹 Operations on Heap

1. **Insertion** → O(log n)
   Insert at the end, then **heapify up** (fix violations upwards).
2. **Deletion (remove root)** → O(log n)
   Replace root with last element, then **heapify down** (fix violations downwards).
3. **Heapify** → O(log n)
   Rearranges a subtree to maintain heap property.
4. **Heap Sort** → O(n log n)
   Build heap, repeatedly extract max/min.

---

## 🔹 STL in C++ (Priority Queue)

C++ already has **`priority_queue`** which is implemented using heaps.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    // Max Heap (default)
    priority_queue<int> maxHeap;

    maxHeap.push(10);
    maxHeap.push(20);
    maxHeap.push(5);

    cout << "Max element: " << maxHeap.top() << endl; // 20

    // Min Heap
    priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<int>> minHeap;

    minHeap.push(10);
    minHeap.push(20);
    minHeap.push(5);

    cout << "Min element: " << minHeap.top() << endl; // 5
}
```

---

✅ **In summary:**

* Heap is a complete binary tree with heap-order property.
* Used for **priority queues** and **heap sort**.
* Operations are logarithmic (`O(log n)`).
* In C++, use `priority_queue` for quick implementation.

Do you want me to also show you how to **implement a heap from scratch using arrays** in C++ (instead of STL)?
