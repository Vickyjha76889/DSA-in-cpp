Introduction
I created this repository to track my progress and organize my solutions as I practice and learn more about data structures and algorithms. Each solution is written in C++ and is a result of my personal efforts to understand and solve the problem efficiently.
Solutions
The solutions are organized by the problem name and, where applicable, the problem number. Each folder typically contains a single C++ file (.cpp) with the complete solution.
Here is an example of the file structure:
/
├── TwoSum
│   └── TwoSum.cpp
├── AddTwoNumbers
│   └── AddTwoNumbers.cpp
└── ...

How to Use
Feel free to explore the repository. If you're looking for a specific solution, you can navigate to the corresponding folder. Each solution file is self-contained and should be easy to understand. The code is commented to explain the logic and the approach taken.
If you want to run a solution locally:
 * Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/Vickyjha76889/DSA-in-cpp

 * Navigate to the problem folder:
   cd your-repo-name/TwoSum

 * Compile the C++ file:
   g++ TwoSum.cpp -o TwoSum

 * Run the executable:
   ./TwoSum

Contributing
This is a personal repository for my learning journey, so I'm not actively looking for external contributions. However, if you find an issue with a solution or have a suggestion for a more optimal approach, feel free to open an issue.
